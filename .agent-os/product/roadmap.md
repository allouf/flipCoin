### Critical Path to Working Flow

- [ ] **End-to-End Testing** - Manual testing of complete game flow `S`

  - Player A makes commitment (heads/tails + secret)
  - Player B makes commitment (heads/tails + secret)
  - Player A reveals choice
  - Player B reveals choice (auto-resolves game)
  - Winner receives payout
  - Verify all funds distributed correctly
