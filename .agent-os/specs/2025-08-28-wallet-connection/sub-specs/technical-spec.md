# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-wallet-connection/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Wallet Adapter Integration
- Implement @solana/wallet-adapter-react v0.15 with providers for all major wallets
- Configure WalletModalProvider for unified wallet selection UI
- Set up ConnectionProvider with dynamic RPC endpoint switching (Devnet/Mainnet)
- Implement custom useWallet hook wrapper for additional functionality

### State Management
- Create Zustand store for wallet state management (connection status, balances, network)
- Implement localStorage persistence layer for auto-reconnection data
- Set up React Query for transaction history caching and refetching
- Create custom hooks: useWalletBalance, useTransactionHistory, useTokenBalances

### UI Components Structure
- **WalletConnectButton**: Primary connection trigger with wallet status display
- **WalletModal**: Selection interface showing all available wallets with detection
- **AccountPanel**: Expandable panel with full account details and actions
- **NetworkSelector**: Dropdown for Devnet/Mainnet switching with confirmation
- **BalanceDisplay**: Real-time balance updates for SOL and SPL tokens
- **TransactionList**: Paginated transaction history with Explorer links

### Network Configuration
- Implement environment-based RPC endpoints (Helius or QuickNode)
- Create network switching logic with connection reset and cache clearing
- Store network preference in localStorage with migration handling
- Add network status indicators with latency monitoring

### Data Fetching
- Fetch SOL balance using Connection.getBalance()
- Get SPL tokens via getParsedTokenAccountsByOwner()
- Retrieve transaction history using getSignaturesForAddress() with pagination
- Query SNS domains through SNS SDK integration
- Implement 5-second polling for balance updates during active sessions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries for wallet connection failures
- Detailed error messages with recovery suggestions
- Retry logic for RPC timeouts with exponential backoff
- Fallback UI states for degraded wallet functionality
- Toast notifications for transaction status updates

### Security Considerations
- Validate all wallet addresses before operations
- Implement CSP headers for wallet interaction security
- No private key exposure in localStorage (only public data)
- Secure session management with timeout handling
- Rate limiting on RPC calls to prevent abuse

## External Dependencies

- **@solana/wallet-adapter-react** - Core wallet connection infrastructure
- **@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets** - Wallet provider implementations
- **@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui** - Pre-built UI components
- **@solana/spl-token** - SPL token account queries
- **@bonfida/spl-name-service** - SNS domain resolution
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Data fetching and caching
- **zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **Justification:** These are essential Solana ecosystem libraries that provide standardized wallet integration, eliminating the need to build custom implementations for each wallet type

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy load wallet adapters to reduce initial bundle size
- Implement virtual scrolling for transaction history
- Cache token metadata to reduce repeated RPC calls
- Use React.memo for expensive account panel renders
- Debounce balance refresh requests during rapid interactions

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all wallet hooks and utilities
- Integration tests for connection flow with mock adapters
- E2E tests for complete wallet connection journey
- Network switching tests with state validation
- Error scenario testing (timeout, rejection, disconnect)
