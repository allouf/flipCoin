# Transaction Reliability Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve transaction reliability issues identified in `result2.md`.

## Issues Identified

### 1. "Blockhash not found" Errors (Lines 43-47)
- **Problem**: Transactions failed due to stale blockhashes
- **Cause**: Network latency and blockhash expiration

### 2. "AccountDidNotSerialize" Errors (Lines 203-275)  
- **Problem**: Enum serialization failures with error code 3004
- **Cause**: Stale account data and improper enum format handling

### 3. Race Conditions in Background Polling
- **Problem**: Multiple simultaneous RPC requests causing state conflicts
- **Cause**: Aggressive polling intervals and lack of request coordination

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Transaction Retry Mechanism (`src/utils/transaction.ts`)

**Improvements:**
- Added proper blockhash refresh before each retry attempt
- Expanded retryable error detection to include:
  - `blockhash not found` / `blockhashnotfound`
  - `simulation failed` / `transaction simulation failed`  
  - `accountdidnotserialize`
  - `network request failed`
  - `rpc response error`
- Added exponential backoff with random jitter (up to 500ms)
- Extended timeout protection (60 seconds)
- Better error logging and retry attempt tracking
- Proper transaction confirmation waiting with blockchain state settling

```typescript
// Enhanced retry logic with better error detection
const isRetryable = isRetryableError(lastError);
const baseDelay = retryDelay * 2 ** attempt;
const jitter = Math.random() * 500;
const delay = baseDelay + jitter;
```

### 2. Improved Enum Serialization Handling (`src/hooks/useAnchorProgram.ts`)

**Enhancements:**
- Added account data refresh before each enum format attempt
- Improved error detection for serialization issues:
  - `AccountDidNotSerialize`
  - `Failed to serialize`  
  - Error code `3004`
- Cache clearing between format attempts
- Extended validation delays (200ms between attempts)

```typescript
// Clear cache and get fresh room data before each attempt
if (formatIndex > 0) {
  console.log(`ðŸ”„ Clearing cache before format ${formatIndex + 1} attempt`);
  rpcManager.clearCache();
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
}
```

### 3. Optimized Background Polling (`src/hooks/useCoinFlipper.ts`)

**Optimizations:**
- **Conservative Timing**: Increased minimum update intervals:
  - Waiting state: 8s â†’ 15s â†’ 30s
  - Selecting state: 6s â†’ 12s â†’ 20s  
  - Resolving state: 5s â†’ 10s â†’ 15s
- **Race Condition Prevention**: 
  - Minimum 10-second gap between updates
  - Better request coordination via RPC manager
  - Skip unnecessary state updates when no changes detected
- **Error Backoff**: Exponential backoff on polling errors (up to 30s)
- **Smarter State Detection**: Only update when significant changes occur

```typescript
const MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 10000; // 10 seconds minimum
if (timeSinceUpdate > MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL) {
  // Only proceed with update
}
```

### 4. Transaction Confirmation Waiting

**Enhancements:**
- Extended confirmation waiting (60-second timeout)
- Proper blockchain state settling delays (1-2 seconds post-confirmation)
- Enhanced post-selection state management:
  - 2.5-second initial delay for transaction confirmation
  - 2-second blockchain state update wait
  - 5-second auto-resolution waiting period

```typescript
// Wait for blockchain state to update after selection
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
rpcManager.clearCache();
await updateGameState(gameState.roomId, true);
```

## Expected Benefits

### 1. Reduced Transaction Failures
- **Blockhash Issues**: Fresh blockhash retrieval on each retry should eliminate "Blockhash not found" errors
- **Serialization Issues**: Account data refresh should resolve "AccountDidNotSerialize" errors
- **Network Issues**: Better retry logic with jitter reduces network-related failures

### 2. Improved User Experience
- Transactions succeed on first attempt more often
- When retries are needed, they happen automatically with better success rates
- Clearer error messages and recovery suggestions

### 3. Reduced Server Load
- Conservative polling intervals (10s minimum vs. 5s previously)
- Better request coordination prevents duplicate RPC calls
- Exponential backoff on errors reduces retry storms

### 4. Better State Synchronization
- Proper confirmation waiting ensures blockchain state is current
- Cache clearing at strategic points prevents stale data issues
- Progressive polling reduces race conditions between multiple users

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Transaction Retry Testing
- Test with intentionally stale blockhashes
- Test enum serialization with account state changes
- Verify retry mechanisms under network stress

### 2. State Synchronization Testing  
- Multi-wallet testing to verify cross-user state sync
- Background polling behavior under different network conditions
- Confirmation timing with various transaction loads

### 3. Performance Testing
- Monitor RPC request frequency and patterns
- Verify reduced server load with new polling intervals
- Check for memory leaks with extended polling sessions

## Configuration Adjustments

If further tuning is needed, key parameters can be adjusted:

```typescript
// Transaction retries (src/utils/transaction.ts)
maxRetries: 3          // Number of retry attempts
retryDelay: 1000      // Base delay in milliseconds

// Polling intervals (src/hooks/useCoinFlipper.ts)  
MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL: 10000  // Minimum time between updates
maxRefreshAttempts: 15      // Maximum polling attempts

// Confirmation delays
initialDelay: 2500          // Post-transaction delay
blockchainSettleDelay: 2000 // Blockchain state update delay
autoResolutionDelay: 5000   // Auto-resolution waiting period
```

## Monitoring Points

Watch for these metrics to verify improvements:

1. **Transaction Success Rate**: Should increase to >95% on first attempt
2. **RPC Request Frequency**: Should decrease by ~40-60%
3. **User-Reported Stuck Games**: Should decrease significantly
4. **Average Game Completion Time**: Should be more consistent
5. **Error Rate**: Particularly "AccountDidNotSerialize" and "Blockhash not found" errors

These fixes address the core reliability issues while maintaining responsiveness and providing a better user experience.
