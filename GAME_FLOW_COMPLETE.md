# Complete Game Flow - Fair Coin Flipper

## Why `created_at` in Smart Contract?

`created_at` is used for:
1. **Cancel Protection** - Games can only be cancelled after 1 hour (3600 seconds)
2. **Frontend Queries** - Sort games by creation time
3. **Analytics** - Track how long games take to complete
4. **Audit Trail** - Know when each game started

```rust
// Only allow cancellation after 1 hour
let time_passed = clock.unix_timestamp - game.created_at;
require!(time_passed > 3600, GameError::TooEarlyToCancel);
```
