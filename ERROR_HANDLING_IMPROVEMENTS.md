# Error Handling Improvements

Based on analysis of old test logs, improved error handling for Anchor program errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RoomNotAvailable Error (Code 6002)
**Before:** Generic error message with technical details
```
Ha: AnchorError caused by account: game_room. Error Code: RoomNotAvailable. Error Number: 6002. Error Message: Room is not available for joining.
```

**After:** User-friendly message
```
"This room is no longer available for joining. It may be full, expired, or cancelled by the creator."
```

### 2. Program Logic Error Handling
**Added specific error messages for:**
- `6001` GameAlreadyStarted: "Cannot join: This game has already started with another player."
- `6002` RoomNotAvailable: "This room is no longer available for joining..."
- `6003` InvalidGameState: "Game is in an invalid state. Try refreshing the page or leaving the game."
- `6004` SelectionTimeExpired: "Selection time has expired. Use 'Handle Timeout' to resolve the game."
- `6005` InsufficientFunds: "Insufficient SOL balance to cover the bet amount and transaction fees."

### 3. Improved Retry Logic
**Program logic errors are now properly marked as non-retryable:**
- Prevents wasted retry attempts on errors that will never succeed
- Better logging: `üö∑ Program logic error detected - will not retry`
- Maintains retry behavior for network/serialization issues

### 4. Generic Anchor Error Fallback
For any unhandled Anchor errors:
```
"Game error (ErrorCode): [Extracted error message]"
```

## Error Classification

### ‚úÖ Retryable Errors
- `AccountDidNotSerialize` (with fresh data)
- `blockhash not found`
- Network timeouts/failures
- `simulation failed`

### ‚ùå Non-Retryable Errors  
- User rejected transaction
- Program logic errors (6001-6005)
- Insufficient funds/lamports
- Invalid program constraints

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Clear, actionable error messages instead of technical jargon
2. **Efficiency**: No wasted retry attempts on logic errors  
3. **Debugging**: Better logging for error classification
4. **Consistency**: Standardized error handling across all Anchor program errors

This ensures users get helpful guidance when errors occur and prevents unnecessary retry attempts on errors that are guaranteed to fail.
