# Auto-Resolution System Upgrade Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide documents the major upgrade to implement automatic game resolution with pre-funded resolution fees, eliminating manual resolve transactions and making cost distribution fair between players.

## ðŸ†• What Changed

### Before (Manual Resolution)
- Players had to manually click "Resolve Game" after both selected
- One player (the resolver) paid all resolution transaction fees (~0.001 SOL)
- Unfair cost distribution led to reluctance to resolve games
- Games could get stuck waiting for manual resolution
- Tie scenarios were not handled properly

### After (Auto-Resolution)
- Games resolve automatically when both players make selections
- Resolution fees (0.0001 SOL per player) are pre-funded during game creation/joining
- Fair cost sharing - both players pay equally upfront
- No manual transactions needed during gameplay
- Proper tie handling with automatic refunds
- Rejoining games is free (no additional blockchain transactions)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

### Smart Contract Updates

#### New Constants
```rust
const RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER: u64 = 10000; // 0.0001 SOL in lamports
```

#### Updated Functions

**1. `create_room()`**
- Now transfers `bet_amount + RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER` to escrow
- Creator pays their share of resolution fees upfront

**2. `join_room()`**
- Now transfers `bet_amount + RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER` to escrow  
- Joiner pays their share of resolution fees upfront

**3. `make_selection()`**
- Auto-calls `auto_resolve_game()` when both players have selected
- No longer transitions to "Resolving" status - goes straight to "Completed"

**4. New `auto_resolve_game()`**
- Handles coin flip generation and winner determination
- Distributes winnings and collects house fees
- Handles tie scenarios with full refunds
- Transfers resolution fees to house wallet

**5. `handle_timeout()`**
- Now refunds `bet_amount + RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER` to each player
- Accounts for pre-funded resolution fees in refunds

**6. `resolve_game()` (DEPRECATED)**
- Now returns error - manual resolution no longer needed
- Kept for backward compatibility during transition

### Frontend Updates

#### Cost Display
- Updated to show: bet + resolution fee share + transaction fees
- More accurate cost calculations and warnings
- Better insufficient balance detection

#### UI Changes
- Removed "Resolve Game" button and manual resolution UI
- Added auto-resolution explanations and status messages
- Updated success messages to mention automatic resolution
- Simplified recovery options for stuck games

#### Constants
```typescript
export const RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER = 0.0001; // Matches smart contract
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Process

### Step 1: Build and Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd F:\flipCoin

# Build the updated contract
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet first for testing
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# Note the Program ID - update constants if needed
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend Configuration

If the Program ID changed, update `src/config/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('YOUR_NEW_PROGRAM_ID');
```

### Step 3: Initialize Program State

```bash
# Initialize the program with house wallet
npm run deploy:init

# Or run manual initialization
npx ts-node scripts/initialize-production.ts
```

### Step 4: Build and Deploy Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting platform
# Copy build/ folder contents to your web server
```

### Step 5: Test the New System

1. **Create a game** - verify cost includes resolution fee
2. **Join the game** - verify cost includes resolution fee  
3. **Make selections** - both players select heads/tails
4. **Verify auto-resolution** - game should complete automatically
5. **Test tie scenario** - both players pick same losing side
6. **Test timeout** - verify refunds include resolution fees

## ðŸ“Š Cost Breakdown

### Per Game Costs (0.01 SOL bet example)

#### Creator Costs
- Bet amount: 0.01 SOL

- Transaction fees: ~0.001 SOL

#### Joiner Costs  
- Bet amount: 0.01 SOL
- Resolution fee share: 0.0001 SOL
- Transaction fees: ~0.001 SOL
- **Total: ~0.0111 SOL**

#### Winner Receives
- Opponent's bet: 0.01 SOL
- Own bet returned: 0.01 SOL
- Less house fee (3%): -0.0006 SOL
- **Total: ~0.0194 SOL**

#### House Collects
- House fee (3% of total pot): 0.0006 SOL
- Both resolution fees: 0.0002 SOL  
- **Total: 0.0008 SOL**

## âœ… Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Game creation shows correct total cost (bet + resolution fee + tx fees)
- [ ] Game joining shows correct total cost (bet + resolution fee + tx fees)
- [ ] Games auto-resolve immediately when both players select
- [ ] Winner receives correct payout (total pot minus house fees)
- [ ] House receives fees + resolution fees after each game
- [ ] Tie games refund both players their full contribution
- [ ] Timeout scenarios refund resolution fees to both players
- [ ] UI no longer shows manual resolve buttons
- [ ] Rejoin functionality works without additional fees
- [ ] Error messages updated for auto-resolution system

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

### Immediate Rollback
1. **Update frontend** to point back to old Program ID
2. **Keep old contract deployed** for immediate fallback
3. **Monitor** for any stuck transactions

### Fix and Redeploy
1. **Identify and fix issues** in new contract
2. **Test thoroughly** on devnet
3. **Redeploy with fixes**
4. **Update frontend** to use new deployment

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Game not auto-resolving"**
- Check both players have made selections
- Verify program logs for errors
- Try refresh state button
- Check network connectivity

**"Incorrect costs displayed"**
- Verify `RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER` constant matches contract
- Check frontend cost calculations
- Clear browser cache

**"Tie games not refunding properly"**
- Check program logs for tie detection
- Verify refund amounts include resolution fees
- Test with different coin flip scenarios

**"Timeout not working"**
- Check timeout thresholds in contract
- Verify refund amounts include resolution fees
- Check account balances before/after

### Getting Help

1. **Check console logs** for specific error messages
2. **Review program logs** with `solana logs <PROGRAM_ID>`
3. **Test on devnet** before mainnet deployment
4. **Verify account balances** before/after transactions
5. **Check transaction signatures** in Solana Explorer

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Benefits

### For Players
- **Fairer costs**: Resolution fees split equally
- **Better UX**: Games complete automatically
- **No wallet popups**: Only pay once during join/create
- **Proper tie handling**: Fair refunds when both lose
- **Free rejoin**: No additional costs to rejoin games

### For the Platform
- **No stuck games**: Automatic resolution eliminates delays
- **Higher completion rates**: No dependency on manual actions
- **Better economics**: More predictable fee collection
- **Reduced support**: Fewer user complaints about stuck games
- **Cleaner UX**: Simplified game flow

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Metrics

Monitor these after deployment:

- **Game completion rate**: Should be 100% with auto-resolution
- **Average game duration**: Should decrease with automatic resolution
- **User complaints**: Should decrease about fees and stuck games
- **Transaction failures**: Should be minimal with better testing
- **House revenue**: Should be more consistent and predictable
