# Smart Contract Security & Bug Analysis Report

## 🔍 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG #1: Resolution Fee Constant Wrong Value**

**File:** `programs/coin-flipper/src/lib.rs` Line 16
**Current:** `pub const RESOLUTION_FEE_PER_PLAYER: u64 = 100_000;`
**Issue:** This is 0.0001 SOL (100,000 lamports), but the comment says 0.0001 SOL
**Problem:** This is actually **0.1 SOL** which is 100x higher than intended!

**Calculation:**
- 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports
- 0.0001 SOL = 100,000 lamports ✅ (Current value is correct)
- But user documentation says 0.0001 SOL

**Status:** ✅ ACTUALLY CORRECT - The value is right, documentation is consistent

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG #2: Invalid Game State Logic Gap**

**File:** Lines 285-292 in `auto_resolve_game()`
```rust
let (winner, winner_account, loser_account) = if p1_selection == coin_result {
    (Some(room.player_1), &ctx.accounts.player_1, &ctx.accounts.player_2)
} else if p2_selection == coin_result {
    (Some(room.player_2), &ctx.accounts.player_2, &ctx.accounts.player_1) 
} else {
    // This should never happen as one player must be correct
    return Err(ErrorCode::InvalidGameState.into());
}
```

**Issue:** The comment "This should never happen" is WRONG! This CAN happen when both players choose the same side and lose.

**Scenario:** Both players pick Heads, coin lands Tails → Both lose, no winner
**Current behavior:** Throws `InvalidGameState` error
**Expected behavior:** This is handled by the tie detection above (line 236)

**Status:** ✅ ACTUALLY SAFE - Tie detection happens first, so this code is unreachable in tie scenarios

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG #3: Escrow Balance Validation Missing**

**Issue:** No validation that escrow has sufficient funds before transfers
**Risk:** Transfer could fail if escrow is somehow drained

**Example scenarios where this could fail:**
- Concurrent transactions
- Reentrancy attacks (though CPI protects against this)
- Manual escrow manipulation

**Fix Required:** Add balance checks before all transfers

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG #4: Player Account Validation Missing**

**File:** Lines 693, 700 in `MakeSelection` struct
**Issue:** Player account constraints don't check if player_2 is actually set (could be default Pubkey)

```rust
constraint = player_2.key() == game_room.player_2 @ ErrorCode::InvalidPlayer
```

**Risk:** If player_2 is `Pubkey::default()`, anyone could provide default pubkey and match

**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Function already validates `room.status == SelectionsPending` which requires player_2 to be set

### 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG #5: Timeout Edge Case**

**File:** Lines 421-434 in `handle_timeout()`
**Issue:** If player_2 never joined, only player_1 gets refunded, but escrow holds funds for both

**Current logic:**
```rust
if room.player_2 != Pubkey::default() {
    // Refund both players
} else {
    // Only player_1 refunded, but escrow only holds player_1 funds anyway
}
```

**Status:** ✅ SAFE - If player_2 never joined, escrow only holds player_1 funds

## 🟡 MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES

### **ISSUE #6: Missing Global State Mutable Borrow**

**File:** Line 349 in `auto_resolve_game()`
```rust
let global_state = &mut ctx.accounts.global_state;
```

**Issue:** This mutable borrow happens after immutable borrows were used
**Risk:** Potential borrow checker issues
**Fix:** Move mutable borrow to top of function

### **ISSUE #7: Redundant Room Status**

**File:** Lines 567-568 in `RoomStatus` enum
**Issue:** `Resolving` status is defined but never used with auto-resolution
**Risk:** Confusion and dead code

### **ISSUE #8: Unchecked Room ID Collisions**

**Issue:** No validation that room IDs are unique per creator
**Risk:** If same creator uses same room_id, PDA collision would occur
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Anchor PDAs prevent collisions automatically

## 🟢 LOW SEVERITY ISSUES

### **ISSUE #9: Magic Numbers**

**File:** Lines 127, 383, 387
**Issue:** Hardcoded timeout values (7200, 600)
**Recommendation:** Define as constants

### **ISSUE #10: Potential Integer Overflow in Game Statistics**

**File:** Lines 350-351
```rust
global_state.total_games = global_state.total_games.saturating_add(1);
global_state.total_volume = global_state.total_volume.saturating_add(total_pot);
```

**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Using `saturating_add` prevents overflow

## 🔄 FLOW ANALYSIS

### **Game Flow 1: Normal Game**
1. ✅ `create_room()` - Creator pays bet + resolution fee
2. ✅ `join_room()` - Joiner pays bet + resolution fee  
3. ✅ `make_selection()` P1 selects
4. ✅ `make_selection()` P2 selects → Auto-resolve triggered
5. ✅ `auto_resolve_game()` - Winner gets payout, house gets fees

**Status:** ✅ NO STUCK STATES

### **Game Flow 2: Tie Game**
1. ✅ Both players select same side (e.g., both Heads)
2. ✅ Coin lands opposite (Tails)
3. ✅ Tie detected (line 236), both players refunded
4. ✅ Game marked as Completed with no winner

**Status:** ✅ NO STUCK STATES

### **Game Flow 3: Timeout Scenarios**

**3A: Creator timeout (no joiner)**
1. ✅ `create_room()` - Creator pays bet + resolution fee
2. ❌ No one joins for 2 hours
3. ✅ `handle_timeout()` - Creator refunded bet + resolution fee
4. ✅ Room marked as Cancelled

**3B: Selection timeout**
1. ✅ Both players joined
2. ❌ One player doesn't select within 10 minutes
3. ✅ `handle_timeout()` - Both players refunded
4. ✅ Room marked as Cancelled

**Status:** ✅ NO STUCK STATES

### **Game Flow 4: Emergency Scenarios**

**4A: Program paused**
1. ✅ Admin calls `pause_program()`
2. ✅ New games blocked
3. ✅ Existing games can still timeout
4. ✅ Admin can `unpause_program()`

**4B: House fee update**
1. ✅ Admin calls `update_house_fee()`
2. ✅ New games use new fee
3. ✅ Existing games use old fee (stored in room)

**Status:** ✅ NO STUCK STATES

## 🛠️ REQUIRED FIXES

### **FIX #1: Add Escrow Balance Validation** ⚠️ CRITICAL

```rust
// Add before all transfer operations
fn validate_escrow_balance(escrow_account: &AccountInfo, required_amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        escrow_account.lamports() >= required_amount,
        ErrorCode::InsufficientEscrowFunds
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

### **FIX #2: Move Global State Mutable Borrow** ⚠️ MEDIUM

```rust
fn auto_resolve_game(ctx: Context<MakeSelection>, room: &mut GameRoom) -> Result<()> {
    // Move this to the top
    let global_state = &mut ctx.accounts.global_state;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    // ... rest of function
}
```

### **FIX #3: Add Missing Error Code** ⚠️ CRITICAL

```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    // ... existing errors
    #[msg("Escrow account has insufficient funds")]
    InsufficientEscrowFunds,
}
```

### **FIX #4: Replace Magic Numbers** ⚠️ LOW

```rust
/// Room expiry timeout (2 hours)
pub const ROOM_EXPIRY_SECONDS: i64 = 7200;
/// Selection timeout (10 minutes) 
pub const SELECTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: i64 = 600;
```

## ✅ COMPREHENSIVE FLOW VERIFICATION

### **All Possible Game States:**

1. **WaitingForPlayer** → JoinRoom → **SelectionsPending** ✅
2. **WaitingForPlayer** → Timeout → **Cancelled** ✅  
3. **SelectionsPending** → BothSelect → **Completed** ✅
4. **SelectionsPending** → Timeout → **Cancelled** ✅
5. **Completed** → Terminal State ✅
6. **Cancelled** → Terminal State ✅

### **All Possible Fund States:**

1. **Creator Only:** Bet + Resolution Fee in escrow ✅
2. **Both Players:** 2×(Bet + Resolution Fee) in escrow ✅
3. **Normal Win:** Winner gets 2×Bet - House Fee, House gets House Fee + 2×Resolution Fee ✅
4. **Tie:** Both players get Bet + Resolution Fee back ✅
5. **Timeout:** All players get Bet + Resolution Fee back ✅

### **Edge Cases Covered:**

1. ✅ Same player tries to join own room → Blocked
2. ✅ Player tries to select twice → Blocked
3. ✅ Non-player tries to select → Blocked
4. ✅ Selection on wrong status → Blocked
5. ✅ Timeout called too early → Blocked
6. ✅ Program paused → New games blocked
7. ✅ Integer overflows → Protected with checked operations

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION

**Status: DEPLOY WITH CRITICAL FIXES**

The smart contract is **fundamentally sound** but needs **3 critical fixes** before deployment:

1. **Add escrow balance validation** (security)
2. **Move global state mutable borrow** (borrow checker)  
3. **Add missing error code** (compilation)

**Estimated fix time:** 15-30 minutes
**Risk level after fixes:** LOW ✅

All game flows work correctly, no stuck states possible, proper economic model implemented.
