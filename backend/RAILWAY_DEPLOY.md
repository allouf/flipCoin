## Environment Variables (Optional)

2. Copy this URL
3. Update your frontend `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
   REACT_APP_WS_URL=wss://your-app.up.railway.app
   ```

## Cost

## Alternative: Railway CLI

If you want to use the CLI:

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link project
cd backend
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

**Note**: The backend is OPTIONAL. The game works without it, but users won't get real-time WebSocket updates. They'd need to manually refresh.
