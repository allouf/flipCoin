# Solana Coin Flipper - Devnet Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup for Testing

The app is now configured for **Devnet** by default, so you can test without spending real SOL!

## 1. Wallet Setup for Devnet

### Using Your Existing Phantom Wallet

**Good news:** You can use your existing Phantom wallet on Devnet! You don't need to create a new account.

**Steps:**
1. Open your Phantom wallet extension
2. Click on the settings (gear icon)  
3. Go to "Developer Settings" or "Change Network"
4. Select **"Devnet"** from the network dropdown
5. Your wallet will now be on Devnet with a 0 SOL balance

### Alternative: Creating a New Devnet Wallet

If you prefer a separate wallet for testing:
1. Create a new wallet in Phantom
2. Switch it to Devnet network
3. Save the seed phrase separately for testing

## 2. Getting Test SOL (Devnet)
