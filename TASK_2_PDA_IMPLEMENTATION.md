# Task 2: PDA Accounts and State Management - Implementation Guide

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced PDA Structure
Added three new PDA account types to the smart contract:

#### **EscrowAccount PDA**
- **Seeds**: `["escrow", creator_pubkey, room_id_bytes]`
- **Purpose**: Manages bet funds and payouts
- **Fields**: `room_id`, `player_1`, `player_2`, `amount`, `status`, `bump`

#### **PlayerStats PDA**
- **Seeds**: `["player_stats", player_pubkey]` 
- **Purpose**: Tracks individual player statistics
- **Fields**: `player`, `total_games`, `wins`, `losses`, `total_wagered`, `total_winnings`, `bump`

### 2. Improved Account Structures
- **GameRoom**: Added `bump` field for PDA seed storage
- **New Enums**: Added `EscrowStatus` (Funded, Released, Refunded)
- **Enhanced Instructions**: `close_room`, `update_global_stats`

### 3. Comprehensive Account Validation
- All PDAs now store their bump seeds
- Cross-account validation (escrow matches room)
- Authority checks for sensitive operations
- Proper account constraints and error handling

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
You need to install the Solana development tools:

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"

# Add to PATH
export PATH="~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest

# Verify installations
rustc --version
solana --version
anchor --version
```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Build and Test
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd F:\Andrius\flipCoin

# Build the program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test
```

### 2. Expected Test Outcomes

#### **Program Initialization Tests**
- ✅ Global state PDA created with proper authority
- ✅ House fee validation (rejects > 10%)
- ✅ Bump seed storage verification

#### **Room Creation Tests**
- ✅ GameRoom PDA initialized with bump
- ✅ EscrowAccount PDA created automatically
- ✅ PlayerStats PDA created/updated for creator
- ✅ Proper account size calculations (206 bytes for GameRoom)

#### **Room Joining Tests**
- ✅ Second player joins successfully
- ✅ EscrowAccount updated with both players
- ✅ PlayerStats created for joiner
- ✅ Room status transitions to SelectionsPending

#### **PDA Derivation Tests**
- ✅ All PDA addresses are deterministic and reproducible
- ✅ Bump seeds properly stored and validated
- ✅ Account ownership verified for all PDA types

## 📊 PDA Architecture Overview

```
Global State PDA
├── Seeds: ["global_state"]
├── Authority: Program authority
└── Stats: Total games, volume

Game Room PDA
├── Seeds: ["game_room", creator_pubkey, room_id]
├── Players: Creator and joiner info
├── Game State: Selections, status, timing
└── Bump: Stored for validation

Escrow Account PDA  
├── Seeds: ["escrow", creator_pubkey, room_id]
├── Funds: Total bet amount from both players
├── Status: Funded/Released/Refunded
└── Bump: Stored for validation

Player Stats PDA (per player)
├── Seeds: ["player_stats", player_pubkey]
├── Statistics: Games, wins, losses, wagered, winnings
└── Bump: Stored for validation
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Account Validation
- Cross-PDA relationship validation (escrow ↔ room)
- Authority checks for admin functions
- Arithmetic overflow protection
- Proper constraint decorators on all accounts

### PDA Security
- Bump seeds stored to prevent address manipulation
- Deterministic derivation patterns
- Program-owned account verification
- Proper space allocation for all account types

## 🎯 Key Improvements from Task 2

1. **Comprehensive State Management**: Three-tier PDA system handles global, room, and player data
2. **Enhanced Account Relationships**: PDAs are properly linked and cross-validated  
3. **Robust Error Handling**: 6 new error codes for PDA-related operations
4. **Storage Optimization**: Proper space calculations including bump seeds
5. **Security Hardening**: All accounts include proper constraints and validations

## 🚀 Next Steps (Task 3)

Once testing confirms PDA implementation:
1. **VRF Integration**: Add Switchboard VRF for random coin flips
2. **Escrow Mechanics**: Implement actual SOL/token transfers
3. **Game Resolution**: Complete the game state machine with winners
4. **Advanced Testing**: Integration tests with real transactions

## 💡 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Install Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor
- [ ] Run `anchor build` successfully  
- [ ] Execute `anchor test` and verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check PDA account creation in test output
- [ ] Verify bump seed storage in accounts
- [ ] Confirm proper account sizes and constraints
- [ ] Test error conditions (invalid fees, unauthorized access)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If tests fail:
1. **Check versions**: Ensure Anchor v0.29.0 compatibility
2. **Network issues**: Tests run on local validator by default
3. **Account conflicts**: Clear test accounts between runs
4. **Dependency issues**: Run `anchor clean` then rebuild

The implementation is ready for testing and should demonstrate a robust, secure PDA architecture for the Solana coin flipper game.
