# Solana Coin Flipper - Complete Documentation

## üìä Project Overview

**Solana Coin Flipper** is a decentralized, provably fair coin-flipping game built on the Solana blockchain. Players compete 1v1 in a trustless environment where all game logic is executed on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness.

### Key Features
- **Provably Fair**: Cryptographic commit-reveal scheme prevents cheating
- **Fully Decentralized**: All logic runs on Solana blockchain
- **Auto-Resolution**: Games resolve automatically when both players reveal
- **Instant Payouts**: Winners receive funds directly to their wallet
- **No Trust Required**: Smart contract handles all fund management

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract (Program)
- **Program ID**: `7CCbhfJx5fUPXZGRu9bqvztBiQHpYPaNL1rGFy9hrcf6`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Language**: Rust with Anchor Framework
- **Deployment**: Solana Playground

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Blockchain SDK**: @solana/web3.js, @coral-xyz/anchor
- **Wallet Integration**: @solana/wallet-adapter
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + DaisyUI
- **Build Tool**: Create React App with Craco

### Game Flow Architecture
```
1. Create Game ‚Üí Player A initiates with bet amount
2. Join Game ‚Üí Player B matches the bet
3. Commit Phase ‚Üí Both players submit encrypted choices
4. Reveal Phase ‚Üí Players reveal their choices
5. Auto-Resolution ‚Üí Smart contract determines winner and transfers funds
```

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Fee Structure
- **House Fee**: 7% of total pot
- **Winner Receives**: 93% of total pot
- **Cancellation Fee**: 2% per player (for games stuck > 1 hour)

### Bet Limits
- **Minimum Bet**: 0.01 SOL
- **Maximum Bet**: 100 SOL

### Example Calculation
```
Bet Amount: 1 SOL per player
Total Pot: 2 SOL
House Fee: 0.14 SOL (7%)
Winner Payout: 1.86 SOL (93%)
```

## üîê Security & Fairness

### Commit-Reveal Scheme
1. **Commitment Phase**: Players submit SHA-256 hash of (choice + secret)
2. **Reveal Phase**: Players reveal choice and secret
3. **Verification**: Smart contract verifies commitment matches reveal
4. **Resolution**: Coin flip result determined, funds transferred

### Anti-Cheat Mechanisms
- **Hidden Choices**: Choices encrypted until both commit
- **Commitment Verification**: Smart contract validates all reveals
- **Timeout Protection**: Games can be cancelled after 1 hour
- **Tie-Breaker**: Cryptographic hash determines winner if both choose same

### Fund Security
- **Escrow Accounts**: All funds held in program-derived accounts
- **Atomic Transfers**: Winners paid automatically on resolution
- **No Manual Claims**: Eliminates trust requirements

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Game States
1. **WaitingForPlayer**: Game created, waiting for opponent
2. **PlayersReady**: Both players joined, ready for commitments
3. **CommitmentsReady**: Both committed, ready for reveals
4. **RevealingPhase**: One player revealed, waiting for other
5. **Resolved**: Game complete, winner paid
6. **Cancelled**: Game cancelled due to timeout

### Timeout Rules
- **Game Creation**: No timeout, can wait indefinitely
- **After Joining**: Players must commit within reasonable time
- **Cancellation**: Available after 1 hour in any non-resolved state
- **Refund**: Bet minus 2% cancellation fee
