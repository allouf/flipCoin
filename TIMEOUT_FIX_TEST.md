# Timeout Handling UI Refresh Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Summary
Previously, when users clicked "Handle Timeout" during a timed-out game, the blockchain transaction would execute successfully but the UI wouldn't refresh properly to show the completed timeout state.

## Fix Applied
1. **Fixed `userWantsToLeaveRef` flag handling** - Properly reset the flag before state updates to allow UI refreshes
2. **Added immediate local state update** - Set game state to 'completed' immediately after successful transaction
3. **Added blockchain state refresh** - Automatically refresh from blockchain after timeout handling
4. **Enhanced logging** - Added detailed console logs to track the timeout handling flow
5. **Improved UI completion state** - Updated UI to show proper success message and "Play Again" button

## Testing Instructions

### Pre-Test Setup
1. Ensure wallet is connected with sufficient SOL for testing
2. Open browser console to monitor logs
3. Have the coin flip game running locally

### Test Case 1: Normal Timeout Handling
1. **Create a new game** and wait for another player to join
2. **Let the selection timeout occur** (don't make any selections)
3. **Wait for timeout detection** - UI should show "Game Timeout Detected" with "Handle Timeout" button
4. **Click "Handle Timeout" button**
5. **Expected Results:**
   - Console shows detailed timeout handling logs:
     ```
     🔄 Handling timeout for room: [roomId]
     ✅ Timeout blockchain transaction successful: [txHash]
     ✅ Reset userWantsToLeave flag to allow state updates
     📱 Setting local game state to completed...
     📱 Local state updated: [state object]
     🔄 Refreshing game state from blockchain...
     ✅ Blockchain state refresh completed successfully
     ```
   - UI immediately updates to show:
     - ✅ "Timeout Handled Successfully" header (green)
     - 💰 Refund details showing bet amount returned
     - 🎮 "Play Again" button appears
     - ⏰ Timeout emoji in game result area

### Test Case 2: Verify State Persistence
1. **After successful timeout handling** from Test Case 1
2. **Refresh the browser page**
3. **Expected Results:**
   - Game state should remain "idle" (not rejoin the timed-out game)
   - No error messages or stuck states
   - User can create new games normally

### Test Case 3: Console Log Verification
During timeout handling, verify these logs appear in correct order:
```javascript
🔄 Handling timeout for room: [roomId]
✅ Timeout blockchain transaction successful: [txHash]
✅ Cleared abandoned room after successful timeout
✅ Reset userWantsToLeave flag to allow state updates
📱 Setting local game state to completed...
📱 Local state updated: {...}
🔄 Refreshing game state from blockchain...
✅ Blockchain state refresh completed successfully
```

### Test Case 4: Error Handling
1. **Try handling timeout on a game that can't be timed out** (e.g., single-player room)
2. **Expected Results:**
   - Appropriate error message
   - UI doesn't get stuck in loading state
   - User can still leave or abandon the game

### Test Case 5: UI Visual Verification
After successful timeout handling, verify UI shows:
- ✅ Green success box instead of yellow warning box
- 💰 "Refund Details" section with correct bet amount
- 🎮 "Play Again" button (no longer hidden for timeouts)
- 🌐 Transaction link to Solana explorer (if txSignature is present)

## What Was Fixed
- **Race condition**: `userWantsToLeaveRef` was preventing state updates after timeout
- **Missing refresh**: No blockchain refresh was happening after successful timeout
- **Stale UI**: Local state was updated but UI wasn't re-rendering properly
- **Poor UX**: Timeout completion UI still showed "Handle Timeout" button

## Code Changes Made
1. **`useCoinFlipper.ts:handleGameTimeout`** - Fixed flag handling and added refresh logic
2. **`BlockchainGame.tsx`** - Updated timeout completion UI to show success state
3. **Enhanced logging** throughout the timeout handling flow

## Success Criteria
✅ Clicking "Handle Timeout" immediately refreshes UI to show completion
✅ Console logs show proper execution flow
✅ "Play Again" button appears after timeout handling
✅ No more stale/stuck UI states after timeout
✅ Users can continue playing normally after timeout resolution
